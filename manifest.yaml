description: Attempts remote command execution over SNMP using known credentials.
safe: true
remediation_suggestion: >-
    Use SNMPv3 with the authPriv security level, if possible.

    Treat community strings as passwords.

    Enable the read-only build option (NETSNMP_NO_WRITE_SUPPORT).

    Configure SNMP to use read-only community strings.

    Apply security updates to your Net-SNMP installation.

    Limit access over SNMP to trusted hosts.

    Note that even with only read access, an SNMP server can still expose crucial
    information about the network.


    The machine is vulnerable to an attack on Net-SNMP via
    [CVE-2020-15862](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15862)
    An Infection Monkey Agent executed a command over SNMP using
    stolen/configured credentials or community strings. This attack was
    possible because the version of Net-SNMP running on the server has not had
    security patches applied.
